 Number Plate Recognition System using YOLOv8 + OCR
This project is a real-time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that detects and recognizes vehicle license plates from images and videos using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

Key Features
Uses YOLOv8 for high-speed, accurate license plate detection.

Employs EasyOCR and Tesseract to extract text from detected plates.

Capable of processing both static images and live video feeds.

Supports real-time data logging with timestamps using Pandas.

Includes robust preprocessing: grayscale conversion, denoising, edge detection, and contour filtering.

Modular Python codebase for easy integration and testing.

 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, EasyOCR, Tesseract OCR, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Frameworks: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO
